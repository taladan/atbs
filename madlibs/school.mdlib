The First Day of School
One very nice morning near the end of summer, my mother woke me up at 4:00 A.M. and said, "Wake up and smell the grass, sleepy head! Today is your first day of school and you can't be late." I groaned in my bed for twenty seconds, but eventually I got dressed. I wore a blue and white striped, long sleeve _______________(NOUN) with a collar on it, a red tie, dark gray pants, white socks, black shoes, and a(n) _______________(ADJECTIVE) hat. In ten minutes I made lunch and ate my breakfast. _______________(NUMBER) minutes later, the bus came. A few minutes later, I was at school.  In school, I met two really _______________(ADJECTIVE) kids. All of us became friends very fast. That day we had Science, and luckily my friends and I were at the same _______________(NOUN) .My friends' names are _______________(PROPER NOUN) and _______________(PROPER NOUN). In Math we weren't together, and that really bugged me. We learned what _______________(PLURAL NOUN) were, and when to use them. At snack and recess, we played a game together. It was extremely fun. At P. E., we were ____________(-ING VERB) off of the ropes onto _______________(PLURAL NOUN). I thought it was a very _______________(ADJECTIVE) idea. In swimming class, we needed to swim extremely _______________(ADVERB), or else we would have to swim longer.  Before I knew it, school was over. I grabbed all my belongings and put them into my backpack. In two minutes, the bus came. As I stepped into the bus I shouted, "Goodbye, adios amigos, and shalom," to my friends. Then I went into the bus. In a flash, I was back home. This day was an extremely exciting day!
